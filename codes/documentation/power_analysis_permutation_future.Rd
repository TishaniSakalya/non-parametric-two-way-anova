\title{Power Analysis Using Permutation Testing}
\arguments{
\item{n_per_group}{Numeric. Number of subjects per group in the two-way factorial design.}

\item{effect_size}{Numeric. The effect size for the interaction term between factors A and B.}

\item{num_simulations}{Numeric. The number of simulations to run.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric. The significance level (default is 0.05).}

\item{B}{Numeric. The number of permutations to perform in each simulation.}
}
\value{
A list containing the estimated power for each effect (main effects and interaction).
\itemize{
  \item estimated_power_A: Estimated power for the main effect of A.
  \item estimated_power_B: Estimated power for the main effect of B.
  \item estimated_power_interaction: Estimated power for the interaction effect.
  \item num_simulations: Number of simulations performed.
  \item alpha: Significance level used for the power calculation.
}
}
\description{
This function performs a power analysis for a two-way factorial design using permutation testing.
It estimates the statistical power for the main effects and their interaction by running multiple simulations.
